# Rice Bootcamp Module 2: Advanced CSS Portfolio

## User Story
AS AN employer <br>
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples <br>
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position <br>

## Features
Primarily, I've included extensive work with Flexbox, Media Queries and CSS styling to highlight my projects thus far. 
## Mock-Up
